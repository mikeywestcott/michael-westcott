        <h2>Story Capturing Wedding Videography, Scotland</h2>
        <p>Wedding video packages from an award winning videographer based in Aberdeen, Scotland. My name is Michael Westcott and my goal is to create cinematically beautiful and engaging wedding films with a cohesive narrative style. I bring your memories back to life via a visually beautiful film; your wedding day captured and kept forever using state of the art videographer equipment.</p>
        <p>I love to produce beautiful and personal wedding films that mean the world to my customers. Using my videography experience I combine a relaxed and professional approach to filming your wedding day. I can turn your most cherished memories into a breathtakingly sensational wedding video, which you will be able to adore and hold dear for many years to come.</p>
        <p>The wedding video packages that I offer include all day filming, which provides me with the time to capture every moment as it comes. My filming style is discrete, permitting the ability to capture natural, beautiful wedding day moments which are not possible when scripted.</p>
        <p>Based in the North East of Scotland in the beautiful city of Aberdeen, I am a dedicated videographer, providing my videography services throughout Glasgow, Edinburgh, Inverness and many more areas of Scotland.</p>
        <p>I never go out without a camera. This is convenient considering filming is my job and passion. Over the past 8 years of working in the film industry, I have developed my shooting style into what it is today. I became a videographer to share my experiences with the world, which has now given me the passion to share my experience and knowledge for your wedding day.</p>
        <p>I take a maximum of 15 wedding bookings per year, to ensure I always spend the required amount of time working on each one & no part of the process is rushed or quality compromised. For information about my videography services and wedding package prices or how I can adjust my packages to suit you, please do not hesitate to get in touch.</p>
