        <p>I love to film and I love to take photographs. I never go out without a camera. Which is convenient considering filming is my job. Over the past 8 years of working in the film industry, I have developed my shooting style into what it is now. I aim to provide very discreet wedding coverage. As a result, the footage I capture allows me to create cinematically beautiful and engaging wedding films with a cohesive narrative style.</p>
        <p>I take a maximum of 15 wedding bookings per year, to ensure I always spend the required amount of time working on each one &amp; no part of the process is rushed or quality compromised.
