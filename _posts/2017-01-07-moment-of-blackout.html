          <p class="mw-lead">One of my favourite music videos I’ve produced for a talented rapper based in London.</p>
          <p> I created this music video with the simple message that the track states - in life when you are pursuing your dreams people are going to fill you up with doubt so in return you give them that moment of blackout (meaning the benefit of doubt) and surprise them with the unexpected. Also growing up in poverty and having most of Juvey’s families dwelling in that condition gives him the drive not to give up until he achieves that ultimate victory.</p>
